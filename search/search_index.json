If you already have auto dimming mirrors and want to get a compass mirror then it should be plug and play</p> <p>So wasn't that interested in swapping out to just an auto dimming but after seeing some info about US S4 B6 cabriolets having a digital compass fitted to it and that they were straight fit into S3 8Ls I kinda liked the idea of trying it out. Part number is 8H0 857 511 B but i think that covers non compass as well so you need to make sure you get the right one if you decided to do it. has a sticker on the inside that says kompass on it ,though I'm not sure why it's spelt with a K </p> <p></p> <p>Tracked down a unit off eBay from Tennessee and thankfully eBay makes international shipping very easy. In total with shipping and import fees i paid just under \u00a380 all in.</p> <p>As you can see with it turned off there is no sight of a cutout for the compass unless you get the right angle up close which i really like</p> <p> </p> <p>You can see the mounting point is the same</p> <p></p> <p>Now onto getting it wired in, didn't find a ton of info out there about it but found enough to get me started and then figure out the rest along the way. The plug on the mirror has 6 pins and from what i gathered you can wire 2 wires to make it work or 4 to get to get it fully working.</p> <p>The connector you need to plug into the mirror is 4B0 971 833 and i used some 0.5mm thinwall wire to wire it all in. Found a few wiring diagrams which were saying different things from each other so i played around with a spare battery to figure out what is needed.</p> <p>Pin 1 Ignition Live Pin 2 Ground Pin 4 reverse signal (needs a ground to work) Pin 6 Interior light (needs a ground to work) Pin 3-5 leave blank (I believe these are signal wires that go to the left and right wing mirrors on some models of Audi that have auto dimming wing mirrors)</p> <p>So it will work with just power and ground but adding pins 4-6 will disable the auto dimming when you put the car into reverse or you turn on the interior lights. Going off diagrams i wired pin 6 into pin 1 of the interior light plug and ran wire for pin 4 to the glovebox but blanked it off there until i figure out where i need to splice it into.</p> <p></p> <p>decided to also run the hardwire for my detector at the same time</p> <p></p> <p>Everything back together now and all working after some calibrations. I do quite like having a compass there, don't actually have a need for it but i guess it's just satisfying having the extra feature</p> <p></p> <p>here is some calibration info that i found for the compass mirror on an S5 but after testing it does also work the same for the A4 one</p> <p></p> <p>For the UK you want to set it to 9</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Double%20Din%20Fascia%20install/","title":"Double Din Fascia install","text":"<p>Thought i would put up a little guide on what i did to get a fascia to fit a double din aftermarket head unit.</p> <p>edit* you will need an original S3 double din housing to start with, i got mine through someone breaking their S3. They do come up on eBay every now and then but are not the cheapest things.</p> <p>Started off with getting an audi A4 B6 fascia which from what I found after searching is the closest fit to the S3. I decided to go with Connects2 CT24AU16 cheap enough and seems to be the popular one to get.</p> <p>First fitment shows that it the top slides in but is very tight and you can see how much need to be cut at the bottom of it.</p> <p></p> <p>So went about first sanding down the edges on the top of both side until it would slot in without much effort and the top piece wouldn't bend</p> <p></p> <p>After that i measured up how much i needed to cut off the bottom, about 4mm need to be cut off so went with 3.5mm which i cut with a cutting disc on a dremal. the dremel leaves it very messy so snapped off all the melted bits then moved on to sanding it down that last .5mm, taped the sand paper to the table so i had a nice flat surface and when i was going over it i kept it perfectly flat to not curve the edges.</p> <p></p> <p>Once i was happy with the bottom fitment i notice the top was not sitting as flat as i wanted.</p> <p></p> <p>Looked at what it was sitting on to see if i could take it down some, was catching on some metal bits on the housing and also a little bit at the top of the fascia. Decided to cut 3.5mm from the top corners which seemed just about right.</p> <p></p> <p>Onto the housing, this bit i didn't like the most but turned out alright tbh. So there was 2 bits of metal that needed trimming down which i used a sanding drum dremal bit which took it down easy enough. While i was there i noticed 2 other bits of metal hanging down from the top that are gonna interfere with the double din cage. So also took the sanding drum to those as well and just smoothed them down.</p> <p> </p> <p>With all that done everything sit flush and i'm happy with the fitment. Fitted the cage and notice it was bowing in on both sides, after i pulled it back out you could see there was some material on the inside of the fascia so a bit of sanding with the sanding drum again and cleaned it up.</p> <p></p> <p>And with that fitted the cage and slotted the head unit in, all still a bit tight but it's reasonable and i can remove it without much trouble. Everything is flush and it came out better than i thought it would</p> <p> </p> <p>some pics with it in the car</p> <p> </p>"}]}
